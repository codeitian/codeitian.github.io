            <p>To the <b> Love of My Life</b>, <br> <br>  I wanna make this sound as genuine as possible, I want you to know how much you mean to me.
<br> <br> 
                Because of you, I, now believe in the saying that "great things come unexpectedly".
                <br> <br> 
                You know me, I have plans for my life but, you, us, being in it wasn't a part of it. Maybe the reason why is that you are going to be a part of my <b>life</b> not just my plans.
                <br> <br> 
                You already know this. I wasnâ€™t really into you at first. Itâ€™s not because I donâ€™t want you, but because Iâ€™m stopping myself from being into you, â€™cause thereâ€™s no way I got so in love that quick.
                <br> <br> 
                I am so in love with your smile. This what plays in my head when I see u. ðŸ’—
                <br><br>

                Idk if u still remember this reel that I sent you on IG but that's really what was happening to me back then. My brain thinks it ain't smart to fall in love with someone that's young for my age. Someone who might not have the same goals as me and what if we just hurt each other (?)
                <br> <br> 
                Yet here I am risking it all. You are worth the risk Jen, Jennel, Jennie Co, Jennel ko, GF ko. You're still not part of my plan, 'coz you are THE plan. I can see my future with you, my love.
                <br> <br> 
                Forgive me for not treating you the way you deserve, I promise I'll do my best to do so. I know I ain't a perfect boyfriend yet, 'coz I've never been a real one to anyone but you.
                <br> <br> 
                You are my first, and I want you to be my last. But it takes two to tango, so please, letâ€™s make this work for a lifetime.
                <br> <br> 
                The one thing that I so want to say to you in person is the word "I love you". I know I never said it in chats 'coz I want me to mean it. I never have said it to anyone so I want it to be special. I'm sorry I'm afraid you won't say it back.
                <br><br>
                I love you, my love.ðŸŒ·ðŸ’˜
                <br><br>
                Always and forever,<br>
