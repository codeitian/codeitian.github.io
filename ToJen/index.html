i hate u jen
<br><br>

i hate that i miss u and i love u
<br><br>

i hate that u think i'm only frustrated when u're cutting me off.
<br><br>

im.losing.my.mind.you.are.cutting.me.off. it hurts me and it keeps hurting me
<br><br>

u're not the one to say u're being abandoned when u have done it to me more than once
<br><br>

i hate that I'm afraid to express myself anymore cause you're gonna cut ur communications again and I'm gonna be left alone with a heavy heart w/ my thoughts
<br><br>

i know i am no innocent, i am aware of where im lacking as a bf, i apologize, only if u knew what i did to try to make sure that i will make it up but u keep cutting me off, u aint saying it but u keep making me feel that u don't want me. i can't remember how many times i said this to u but im gonna say it again, i hate forcing things to happen, especially people
<br><br>

i hate myself for caring...
<br><br>

told myself to not care enough but here I am hurting cause I care
<br><br>

i hate that i want us back, i hate that i love us
<br><br>

there's not a time that i haven  't thought 'bout u, u are in my dreams and we're okay but in reality we're not
<br><br>
 
sometimes i wish i never woke up
<br><br>

i always wanna reach out but the thought that this is just gonna happen again holds me back
<br><br>

i don't like it when i can't contact u, I don't like being alone with my thoughts
<br><br>

i've been ignored my whole life, i thought i couldn't be hurt anymore, turns out im wrong
<br><br>

            <p>To the <b> Love of My Life</b>, <br> <br>  I wanna make this sound as genuine as possible. I want you to know how much you mean to me.  

                <br> <br> 
                You are the reason, I now believe in the saying that "great things come unexpectedly." 
                <br> <br> 
                You know me so well. I like having plans for my life, but you‚Äîus‚Äîbeing in it wasn't a part of those plans. Maybe the reason why is that you're going to be a part of my life, not just my plans.  
                <br> <br> 
                You already know this. I wasn‚Äôt really into you at first. It‚Äôs not because I didn‚Äôt want you but because I was stopping myself from being into you, ‚Äôcause there‚Äôs no way I fell in love that quick.
                <br> <br> 
                I am so in love with your smile. Kurba by Maki plays in my head when I see u. 
                <br><br>
                One of my favorite feelings is when I see you laughing.
                <br><br>
                I love your presence so much that I would rather be stuck in traffic with you than go home to a house that doesn‚Äôt feel like home.
                <br><br>
                I loved how I felt loved when I was with you.üíó
                <br><br>
                You have no idea how much I miss you.
                <br><br>
                
                <div class="breaker">I LOVE US</div>
                <br>
                </p>
                <p>
    
                Idk if you still remember that one specfic reel I sent you on IG, but that‚Äôs really what was happening to me back then. Where my heart does not align with my brain. My brain kept thinking it wasn‚Äôt smart to fall in love with someone younger than me. Someone who might not have the same life goals as me. And what if we just hurt each other?
                <br> <br> 
                Yet here I am risking it all. You are worth the risk Jen, Jennel, Jennie Co, Jennel ko, GF ko. Nonetheless, you're still not part of my plan, 'coz you are THE plan. I can see my future with you, my love.
                <br> <br> 
               
                You are my first, and I want you to be my last. So please, let‚Äôs make this work for a lifetime.
                
                <br> <br> 
                I know we‚Äôve had so many arguments. I do not hate you when I don't talk to you, I am upset with myself because I care so much that it's hurting me.
                <br> <br> 
                Forgive me for not treating you better the way you deserve, I promise I'll do my best to be the man for you. I know I ain't a perfect boyfriend for you yet, 'coz I've never been a real BF to anyone but you.
                <br> <br> 

                The one thing I really want to say to you in person is the word ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù I know I‚Äôve never said it in chats ‚Äôcause I want me to mean it. I‚Äôve never said it to anyone, so I want it to be special. I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm afraid you won‚Äôt say it back.
                <br><br>
                I miss you and I love you, my love.üå∑üíü
                <br><br>
                <br>
                Always and forever,<br>
                Your man
